This project demonstrates how to integrate Spring Boot, Spring Security, and JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication and authorization.

- User registration and login with JWT-based authentication.
- Role-based authorization for controlling user access to different parts of the application.
- Secure password hashing and salting using industry best practices.
- Integration with PostgreSQL database for storing user information.

## Install

- Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/DevN0t/spring-boot-3-spring-security6-jwt-token.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd spring-boot-3-spring-security6-jwt-token
Update the database configuration in application.properties file.
Build the project: ./mvnw clean install (or equivalent for Windows: mvnw.cmd clean install)
Run the application: ./mvnw spring-boot:run (or equivalent for Windows: mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run)


## Configuration

- Database Configuration: Update the application.properties file with your PostgreSQL database credentials.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DevN0t/spring-boot-3-spring-security6-jwt-token.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd spring-boot-3-spring-security6-jwt-token`
3. Update the database configuration in `application.properties` file.
4. Build the project: `./mvnw clean install` (or equivalent for Windows: `mvnw.cmd clean install`)
5. Run the application: `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (or equivalent for Windows: `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`)


## Endpoints

- `POST /user/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /user/login`: Obtain a JWT by logging in.
- `GET /user/get`: Get all registred users(Admin Role needed).
- More endpoints for specific resources can be added as per your application's requirements.
